        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            Ying Wanapagron is undergraduate student deeply fascinated by the power of technology to unravel complex challenges,
            She is majoring in Computer Science, with additional minors in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), 
            Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Data Decision Analytics at Virginia Tech. 
            Her academic journey has led her to develop proficiency in using ArcGIS Pro for detailed spatial analysis and mapping, 
            bolstered by a strong foundation in data analytics. 
            Her has experience implementing linear regression machine learning 
            models in Python for predictive analysis and is proficient in Natural Language Processing (NLP), utilizing both R and Python. 
            She specializes in extracting insights from text data and scraping data from various online platforms, including consumer reviews, 
            e-commerce platforms, and social media. Her academic pursuits reflect a commitment to continuous learning and a keen interest in emerging technologies. 
            Wanapagron aims to drive innovative solutions and make significant contributions to technology and data analytics, embodying a forward-thinking approach 
            to tackling challenges in her field. Her dedication is geared towards creating impactful, data-driven decisions in an ever-evolving technological landscape.

        <h3>Career Vision</h3>
        <p>
            Since she was young, she has been passionate about agriculture in Thailand. She aims to apply her knowledge of technology to build tools that help farmers manage
            their farms more conveniently and affordably, thereby reducing the cost of agricultural products. This reduction in costs benefits others by making food more 
            affordable and reducing chemical usage to improve health.

            Her career objective is to become a data scientist and software developer in the agriculture field. Her goal is to lower costs for farmers, enabling them to produce more and better quality products while allowing consumers to enjoy healthy and affordable food. Moreover, she aspires to become a farmer herself and establish a farmers' cooperative in Thailand to ensure sustainability and reduce the impact of middlemen who profit from both farmers and consumers, promoting fair trade within society. This is the reason why she chose to study computer science, with a concentration in Data, GIS, and software development.
